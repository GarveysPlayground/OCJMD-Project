member classes, are they simply inner classes?(Used in DBmain.java for exceptions).

Instructions specify that the classes to handle exceptions MUST "be created as

should be and inner class of DBmain, or a normal class?

To make Accessing database file easier, we should use RandomAccessFile, 
because it can seek to the certain byte location back and forward. I 
think it is the best approach for accessing database file easier. So, 
use it. Simplicity is the key for passing this tough exam.

valid and invalid is of type int in FileAccess,
Change this to byte []?

Subcontractor class are all set to Stings. No distinction between int / floats / double etc. Is that ok?

do some exception handling in the DAO

database location. work on the string for the name. Should/shouldnt it contain db-2x3.db

add unbook

Then read(int [x]) reads through them again to get the data

Should FileAccess.getSingleRecord() be replaced with read?

No duplicate key, checks for duplicate record
